# Chapter 3 â€” Set Theory (Python Examples)

This repository contains Python code examples accompanying **Chapter 3: Set Theory** from the book *Probability and Statistics Using Python*.

The main file is `set_operations.ipynb`, which demonstrates basic set operations in Python.

Python is used here as a tool to support understanding of foundational set-theoretic concepts.
